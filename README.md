1. Write a brief description of the application you are imagining. It should walk though who the application is for, what it does, and a few features the user would interact with. 

I am a big fan of turn-based games and would love to build a widely used game like Hearthstone or Candy Crush. However, I wanted to start here with something smaller that I could see myself completing. So I wanted to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It would allow players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer and see who wins. This application is for anyone who likes playing turn-based games. Players would choose spots on the Tic-Tac-Toe board and see the board react to their choices. Then the computer would make a choice that the players could react to on their next move.

2. For each module of the course, write a 1-2 sentence description of how you could use that knowledge to build an application. You should include at least one skill from all of the following:

○ Organization and Time Management 

My therapist thinks I might have undiagnosed ADD and I think setting up time blocks and using the Pomodoro Technique will help me work through my ADD tendencies. I notice I tend to work in bursts but can get distracted or procrastinate. These strategies will help maximize my bursts of energy and minimize my procrastination.

○ Values, Data Types, and Operations 

I am using the readline-sync module (Values, Data Types, and Operations - 4) to  collect input from users. This will be fundamental to making my game interactive.

○ The Growth Mindset 

I am using effort (taking action, trying to figure out what steps I can take to improve) by pushing through coding issues. Not everything worked right away and I needed to push through and find new ways to accomplish my goals.
I am also using new experiences (embrace opportunities for growth, seeking challenges and connections between skills) by choosing to actually build a Tic-Tac-Toe game. I could’ve just thrown out bits of pseudocode here and there but I put everything together to actually build something.

○ Stringing Characters Together 

I am using string interpolation (Stringing Characters Together - 5) to embed variables directly into strings.
I am using template literals to write strings that span multiple lines without requiring explicit escape characters like \n.

○ Control Structures and Logic 

I am using an if else statement (Control Structures and Logic - 1) to add a computer's turn while ensuring not to override the user's input.

○ Working with Loops 

I am using the do-while loop (Working With Loops - 3) to ensure that user inputs are within the 1-3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid parameters.

○ Building Arrays ○ Using Arrays 
I built a multi-dimensional array (Building Arrays - 4) to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe grid.
